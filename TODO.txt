ecdsa algorithm is correctly working with other library
test ecdsa encode
algorithm and esdsa curve is mismatched
no need SCM_NEW_ARRAY free?

consider other scenario
1. transfer JWT token (unknown encoding yet).
2. decode token (reveal algorithm)
3. read key if need (RSA, ECDSA has each key)
4. verify token by above key


read-jwk-private ->  read-rsa-private read-ecdsa-private ...

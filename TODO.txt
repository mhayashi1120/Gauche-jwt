Check ecdsa algorithm is correctly working with other library (ruby-jwt)
test ecdsa encode

EC_builtin_curve * curves = SCM_NEW_ARRAY(EC_builtin_curve, crv_len);
need free?

considering other scenario
1. transfer JWT token (unknown encoding yet).
2. decode token (reveal algorithm)
3. read key if need (RSA, ECDSA has each key)
4. verify token by above key

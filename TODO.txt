Check ecdsa algorithm is correctly working with other library (ruby-jwt)
test ecdsa encode
When algorithm and esdsa curve is mismatched. Raise error.
no need SCM_NEW_ARRAY free?

considering other scenario
1. transfer JWT token (unknown encoding yet).
2. decode token (reveal algorithm)
3. read key if need (RSA, ECDSA has each key)
4. verify token by above key
